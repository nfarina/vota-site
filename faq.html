          <li>US Bank</li>
          <li>Wells Fargo</li>
          <li>Visa cards offered by a bunch of smaller banks and Credit Unions such as:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Advantis</li>

      <input id="five" type="radio" name="tabs">
      <label for="five">So what happens when I hook up my bank?</label>
      <div class="tab-content">
        <p class="small">We contact your bank using the login info you provide us and then request that we be added as a communication contact. From there, we ask to be notified by your bank every time your credit card is used. Once notifications are in place, we throw out all the login info. Forever. We don’t store your login info. If you visit your account at your bank website, you will see that behind the scenes “Vota” has been added as a contact.</p>

      <input id="six" type="radio" name="tabs">
      <label for="six">Does this bank connection do anything else cool?</label>
      <div class="tab-content">
        <p class="small">Because we send you a mobile-app notification anytime your credit card is used, you can use that same info to catch any fraud such as someone using your credit card without your knowledge! No kidding. We have actually saved people from a surprising amount of fraud. We also think there may be something useful in helping you track your expenses -- let us know what you think!</p>

        <p class="small">Yes, the same process for deleting your card (in order to change it) works to cease our categorization of your purchases.</p>
