    <h4 className="center">(Last updated: May 8, 2018)</h4>

    <p>We at Enlight LLC (“<em>Enlight LLC</em>,” “<em>Enlight</em>,” “<em>we</em>,” “<em>us</em>,” or “<em>our</em>”) created this privacy and security policy (“<em>Policy</em>”) because we know that you care about how information you provide to us is used and shared. This Policy relates to the information collection and use practices of Enlight in connection with our Services which are made available to you through our Platform.</p>

    <p>The terms of this Privacy Policy are incorporated by reference in the Terms of Use that you accept when you register to use our Services (the “<em>Terms of Use</em>”). By accepting the Terms of Use, you accept the terms of this Policy. Capitalized terms not defined in this Policy shall have the meaning set forth in our Terms of Use. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change this Policy at any time, with or without notice. If we make any material changes to this Policy we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on the Platform prior to the change becoming effective. Continuing to use the Services after such notification by Enlight or posting of changes on the Platform will indicate your acceptance of the amended terms, regardless of if you opened or viewed any notice, email, or postings. If you do not agree with any of the amended terms, you must avoid any further use of the Services. We encourage you to periodically review this Policy for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>

    <h3>What Information Do We Collect and/or Receive?</h3>
    <p>In the course of operating the Platform, Enlight will collect (and/or receive) the following types of information. You authorize us to collect and/or receive such information.</p>

    <p><em>Personal Information.</em> When you register to use the Services, we will ask you to provide your email address. Based on the Services you choose, you may be asked to provide additional personal details to complete your registration. In addition, and in order for Enlight to provide you with the transactions from your financial account, credit card and/or debit card statements, you will need to provide us with financial account information, including credit or debit card information, credentials required by your financial institution, your financial institution’s name, and which financial accounts, credit and/or debit card names you wish to monitor in the Platform (collectively, the “<em>Account Credentials</em>”). You may also be asked to provide your contact information (such as name, address, phone number, and e-mail address), sensitive information (such as date of birth, driver’s license number and social security number), and personal information to verify your identity and financial information (such as credit card number) (collectively, the “<em>Additional Personal Information</em>”).  All information we collect and/or receive under this section, together with Account Credentials and Additional Personal Information is collectively referred to herein as the “<em>Personal Information</em>.”  We do not collect any Personal Information from Visitors when they visit the Platform, unless they provide such information voluntarily, such as by registering or contacting us through the Contact Us section of the Platform.</p>

    <p><em>Geolocational Information</em>. Certain location-based features and functionalities of the Services in connection with the App are dependent on the data related to the geographic location of the mobile device on which the App is installed. In order to provide these features and functionalities while a User is using a mobile device, we may, with the User’s consent, automatically collect geolocational information from that User’s mobile device. Such information is collectively called the “<em>Geolocational Information</em>.” Collection of such Geolocational Information occurs only when the Services are running on a User’s mobile device. Users may decline to allow us to collect such Geolocational Information, in which case we will not be able to provide certain features or functionalities to that User.</p>

    <p><em>Other Information.</em> In addition to the Personal Information and the Geolocational Information, we may collect or receive additional information (collectively, the “Other Information”). Such Other Information may include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>From Your Activity.</em> In an ongoing effort to improve the Services, we may automatically collect certain information when Visitors visit the Platform and when Users use the Services. For example, this information may include the frequency and scope of your use of the Services, transactions that you made, the Internet protocol (IP) address, or mobile device ID, and the name of the domain that serves you to access the Services, your browser type and the geographic location of the computer system or mobile device that you are using to log-in to the Services.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><em>From cookies and other tracking technologies.</em> We may use cookies with the Services. Cookies are packets of information sent by the Services’ servers to your web browser and then sent back by your browser each time you access the Services’ servers. The cookies may contain a variety of information, such as the content of search queries, the Services’ pages you have accessed, session durations and IP addresses or mobile device ID. The Services may use cookies for various purposes, such as to save you the need to re-enter your user name and password each time you log-in, to facilitate the use of the Services, to collect statistical information with respect to the use of the Services, to verify information, to customize the Services to your personal preferences and for information security purposes. Some of the cookies may expire when your browsing session ends and you exit your browser, however other cookies are saved on your computer&#8217;s or mobile device’s hard drive. If you wish to block the cookies, then please use the help button in your browser, or use the “settings” function in your mobile device, and follow the necessary instructions. However, bear in mind that disabling cookies may complicate or even prevent your use of the Services’ or certain features and functions thereof. In addition, we may make use of web beacons on the Services for user security purposes and in order to improve product service and evaluation. A web beacon is an object that is inserted in an e-mail or web page and is usually invisible to the user. The beacon allows checking that a user has viewed the page or e-mail, allowing us to track user services and website traffic more effectively. In addition to the above, we may collect limited information from your mobile device in order to provide the App. Such information may include your mobile device type, mobile device id, and date and time stamps of App use. We may deploy tracking technologies within the App to help us gather aggregate statistics, but we do not use Personal Information for such purposes.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not collect Personal Information in this way, but if you’ve provided us with Personal Information we may associate that information with the information that is collected automatically and use such information to improve the Services. Automatic data collection may be performed on our behalf by our services providers who may provide us with reports about the data collected by such service providers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information Security</h3>

    <p>We use commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard your Information from any unlawful interceptions or access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse.

Among such security methods is the storing of your Information on cloud services, firewalls, encryption codes, authentication procedures and multi layer passwords. Furthermore, we implement employee supervision and prevent unnecessary access to data. Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the Information that you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the Internet.

Please also be aware that certain Personal Information and other information provided by you in connection with your use of the App may be stored on your mobile device (even if we do not collect that information). You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your mobile device from unauthorized access.</p>
