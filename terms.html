    <li><em>Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Agreement to Arbitrate; Class Action Waiver.</em></li>
    <ol>
      <li><em>Governing Law.</em> These Terms and your use of the Service, and any disputes directly or indirectly arising from these Terms or your use of the Services, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Oregon, U.S.A. without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions, whether Federal, or of the State of Oregon or of any other jurisdiction, which would result in the application of the laws of a jurisdiction other than the state of Oregon.</li>
      <li><em>Jurisdiction.</em> You agree to resolve any dispute or claim that you may have against Enlight exclusively in the state and federal courts located in Oregon. You hereby irrevocably consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, and waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts.</li>
      <li><em>Agreement to Arbitrate.</em> If any dispute arises from these Terms or your use of the Services, either we or you may elect to finally and exclusively resolve the dispute by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). Any election to arbitrate, at any time, will be final and binding on the both parties. IF EITHER PARTY CHOOSES ARBITRATION, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE THAT CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL. DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS MIGHT ALSO BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. All disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award. The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. If conducted in person, the arbitration shall take place in Oregon. The parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</li>
      <li><em>Class Action Waiver</em>
        <em>.</em> You agree that any arbitration or proceeding will be limited to the dispute between us and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration or proceeding shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated or resolved on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US AND/OR ANY THIRD PARTY PROVIDER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, EXPERIAN) ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</li>
